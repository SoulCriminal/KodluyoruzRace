# My frist Unity Project _Race_

My first demo game that I developed with unity. The graduation project I did at the end of my education.


## How to install?

After creating an empty unity project, you can upload assets.

## How to play?

You can steer only with the a and d keys, and accelerate by crushing the gas cans.

## Important

Scenes may not be ordered correctly after the asset you have loaded. Check this in unity scene settings.
